This is the source code developed during the research of multimodal deep learning architectures for hepatocarcinoma computer-aided diagnosis. The research was done during my master course at UFCSPA, in PPG-TIGSaude.

The datasets used in the research were downloaded from TCIA Project, and are listed below:
